My goal in this project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. I used SQL to extract global and local temperature data, Pandas to analyze it and Matplotlib to create visualizations. I also fit a linear regression model to predict the local temperature using the global temperature as input.
