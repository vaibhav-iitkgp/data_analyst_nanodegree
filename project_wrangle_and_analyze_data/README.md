My goal in this project was to gather, assess, clean and analyze tweet data from the twitter account WeRateDogs. I learned how to gather data in a variety of formats using different Python libraries and APIs (requests, tweepy etc.). I also learned how to assess data for quality and tidiness issues, and clean it using different functions in Pandas. Finally, I used Numpy and Matplotlib to analyze the cleaned data and create visualizations to explain the trends.
