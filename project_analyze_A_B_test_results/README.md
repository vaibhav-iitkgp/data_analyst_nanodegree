My goal in this project was to run an A/B test for a company who launched a new website and needed to decide if they should implement the new website or keep the old one. The company wanted to increase the number of users who purchased their product. I also cross-checked my A/B test results with a logistic regression model using the Python package statsmodels. I made extensive use of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib in this project.
